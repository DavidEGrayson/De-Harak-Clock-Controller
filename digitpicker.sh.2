# You see a list of MAC addresses representing all the nodes on the network
# Pick a line and push enter and what the clock to see which digit blinks. 
# Then enter the name of that digit in the form M00 or H00
# so M11 is the top 11 and H48 is the bottom(only) 48
# If no digit blinks or it is the already assigned one, press enter
#
# Press save when done to write the entires to the dhcphosts file
